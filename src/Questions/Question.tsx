// Important Note
// Dates are often displayed in different formats in different countries. For
// example, February 1, 2021 can be displayed as 02/01/21 or 01/02/21 in different
// countries. toLocaleDateString and toLocaleTimeString
// are methods on the Date object that format the date and time according
// to the browser's locale. More information can be found at
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString
// and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleTimeString

// Important Note
// A JavaScript ternary is a short way of implementing a conditional
// statement that results in one of two branches of logic being executed. The
// statement contains three operands separated by a question mark (?) and a
// colon (:). The first operand is a condition, the second is what is returned
// if the condition is true, and the third is what is returned if the condition
// is false. The ternary operator is a popular way of implementing conditional
// logic in JSX. More information can be found at
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator

// Important Note
// JavaScript template literals are strings contained in backticks (`). A template
// literal can include expressions that inject data into the string. Expressions
// are contained in curly brackets after a dollar sign. This is often referred to as
// interpolation. More information can be found at
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals

// Important Note
// The short-circuit operator (&&) is another way of expressing conditional logic.
// It has two operands, with the first being the condition and the second being the
// logic to execute if the condition evaluates to true. It is often used in JSX to
// conditionally render an element if the condition is true.

// Important Note
// Optional properties are actually a TypeScript feature. Function parameters can
// also be made optional by putting a question mark at the end of the parameter
// name before the type annotation; for example, (duration?:number).
